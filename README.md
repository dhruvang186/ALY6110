In this assignment, you will use PySpark's MLLib library for machine learning exercise. Using Boston House price dataset, you will perform principal component analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression. You will write PySpark/Python code for following activities:

Prepare your google colab PySpark Session as you did before.
Read 'BostonHousing.csv' dataset in PySpark. You may use other dataset as well if you want to.
Combine features to a single vector columns using VectorAssembler (all columns other than target column 'medv')
Standardize features for principal component analysis
Train model for two principal component analysis
Collect distributed data in numpy array and then convert to pandas dataframe
Plot two principal components
Vectorize features and target together for model development
Split dataset into training and testing dataset
Fit model for linear regression
Find out model coefficients and intercept
Evaluate model for test dataset
Based on this exercise you will create a brief report of your analysis 
Perform further analysis for better interpretation of model results
